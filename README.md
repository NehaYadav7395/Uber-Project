# 🚕 Uber Trip Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on an Uber trip dataset consisting of 500 records. The goal of this project is to analyze travel patterns, trip purposes, distance trends, and extract business insights from the dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

* Identify patterns in Uber trip behavior
* Understand travel purpose and category usage
* Clean and preprocess raw dataset for accurate insights

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

The dataset contained raw trip records without clear insights into user behavior, trip purpose trends, or distance patterns. There was no summary to understand travel patterns or business vs personal trip distribution.

Key challenges:

* No initial summary or trend identification
* Dataset required inspection and preprocessing
* Needed visualization to interpret trends effectively

---

## ✅ Solution Approach

To solve the above issues, the following steps were taken:

* Loaded and inspected the dataset
* Checked for missing values and data types
* Converted date columns to proper datetime format
* Cleaned and formatted the dataset for accuracy
* Analyzed trip distances, categories, and purposes
* Plotted visualizations to highlight trends
* Generated meaningful insights and summary reports

---

## 📌 Objective

* Understand trip distribution by category (Business vs Personal)
* Analyze trip distances and travel behavior
* Explore trip purpose and patterns
* Visualize insights using Python libraries
* Prepare clear findings for data-driven decisions

## 🔍 Key Analysis Tasks

* ✅ Load & inspect dataset
* ✅ Check dataset shape and information
* ✅ Clean missing or incorrect values
* ✅ Convert date columns to datetime
* ✅ Analyze trip categories
* ✅ Analyze purpose of trips
* ✅ Visualize trip distribution
* ✅ Generate summary insights

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

* Bar charts: Category & purpose distribution
* Histogram: Miles distribution
* Time‑based trip analysis
* Trend charts

---

## 📈 Insights Summary

* Majority of trips fall under **Business category**
* Personal trips are less frequent than business trips
* Most trips are short to medium distance
* Travel patterns indicate work‑related commuting behavior

*Add actual values after your calculation for better clarity.*
